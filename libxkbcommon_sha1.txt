This version of Qt-Compositor is checked against the following sha1
from the libxkbcommon repository:
3fbc277bb8717d031f9c863935460b895c3d3beb

During the qmake step a configuration test will be compiled to check
if libxkbcommon is available. If not, or it is an incompatible
version, the platform plug-in will be built without keymap support.
