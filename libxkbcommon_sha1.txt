This version of Qt-Compositor is checked against the following sha1
from the libxkbcommon repository:
5be22ad641e96f76ce08a9fd928553b67d627de4

During the qmake step a configuration test will be compiled to check
if libxkbcommon is available. If not, or it is an incompatible
version, the platform plug-in will be built without keymap support.
