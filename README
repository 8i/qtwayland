This is the QtWayland module.

The QtWayland module consists of two parts:

Wayland platform plugin:
    Enables Qt applications to be run as Wayland clients.

QtCompositor API:
    Enables the creation of Wayland compositors using Qt and QtQuick.

To build the QtWayland module you need the external dependencies:
xkbcommon 0.2.0 - http://xkbcommon.org/
libwayland 1.0.1 - http://wayland.freedesktop.org/


We hang out at #qt-labs and #qt-lighthouse on freenode if you have any questions
